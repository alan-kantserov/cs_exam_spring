1)  Consider the following class:

--------------------------------------------------------
public class Technology{
   
  String name;
  
  public Technology(String name){
    this.name=name;}
    
  public void speak(){
    System.out.println("Bleep, blip.  I am a " + name);}
  
  public class Smartphone extends Technology {

    int number;
    
    public Smartphone(String name, int number){
      super(name);
      this.number = number;
   }
    
    public static void speak() {
        System.out.println("Name is "+ name + " number is " + number);
    }
}
    
---------------------------------------------------------    

a)  Write a subclass to Technology with a class called Smartphone.
    Add an additional integer field called number.
    Include a constructor for Smartphone that takes the "name" and "number" as parameters.
b)  Explain what INHERITANCE is.
    Inheritance allows a class to use (inherit) the methods and porperties of another class.
c)  Write a "speak" method for Smartphone that states the "name" and "number".  
d)  What is this called when we write a subclass method which overrides a super class method?
    Overriding - subclass can implement parent class
